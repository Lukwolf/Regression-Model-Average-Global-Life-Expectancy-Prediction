# Regression-Model-Average-Global-Life-Expectancy-Prediction

Our project centers around utilizing data on average life expectancy from the World Health Organization,
spanning 179 countries between 2000 and 2015. Our objective is to construct a predictive regression model,
considering various factors, to offer insights into enhancing a country’s average life expectancy. The ultimate
aim is to empower nations with proactive measures, enabling them to address critical factors and potentially
avert national crises, ultimately fostering longer and healthier lives.
Our progress intends to identify pivotal variables impacting average life expectancy, crafting models that
enable leaders to make informed, data-driven decisions. Our goal is to develop a regression model with high
prediction accuracy, emphasizing relevant variables and extending predictions to unseen data. Additionally,
we aim to uncover insights on the variables most influencing a nation’s life expectancy, proposing strategies
for optimization.
In terms of statistical methodology, we plan to leverage various visual plots (Ex. Residual Plots) to validate
model assumptions and depict life expectancy trends globally. Through regression techniques, we aim to
select an accurate prediction model, verify assumptions, and provide valuable insights for world leaders.
This project holds personal significance for us, particularly those with roots in developing nations. We aspire to
contribute to the improvement of living conditions in these regions, promoting longer and healthier lives to
stimulate overall national growth. We firmly believe that enhancing living conditions globally will yield mutual
benefits for people worldwide, fostering a stronger and more interconnected world.

## Methodology
We aim to streamline our model selection process by employing a systematic approach. Initially, we will utilize
forward selection, followed by backward selection and stepwise methods to identify the most impactful
variables. Subsequently, we will construct a new model incorporating consistently selected variables and
conduct a best subset model selection. This strategy optimizes computational resources by eliminating
insignificant variables first. To further refine our model, we will explore higher order and interaction terms. This approach ensures that we consider the best variables identified through various methods and assess if there
are superior model subsets. Our goal is to strike a balance between computational efficiency and a thorough
search for the best model, ensuring a robust selection process.
The project unfolds in two main phases. First, we conduct an extensive model selection process, followed by
the identification of interaction terms and higher order terms, and then confirming adherence to regression
assumptions. The challenge lies in the subjective nature of model selection, requiring us to leverage collective
knowledge. There is no definitive “wrong” answer in this step, emphasizing the need for a careful and
informed decision-making process. In the event that assumptions are not met, we would utlize corrective
actions such as variable deletion for multicollinearity, log transformation, or box-cox transformation.
Our work is divided into two parts: Lukas and Shabbir will focus on selecting the best model, while Gurdeep
and Harjot will enhance the model with higher order terms, interaction terms, and assess regression
assumptions. Concluded with a joint effort to finalize the write up and report.
